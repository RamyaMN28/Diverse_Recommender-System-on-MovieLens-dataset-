## NCF Based Movie Recommender with ε_Greedy Exploration

This repository contains a movie recommendation system developed using Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) and ε-Greedy Exploration techniques. The system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations by balancing between recommending popular items (exploitation) and exploring new items for diversity and novelty (exploration).


## Features
* NCF Model: NCF typically combines matrix factorization and neural networks to learn user-item embeddings and make recommendations.

* Explore-Exploit Techniques: Implements ε-Greedy Exploration to balance between recommending popular movies.


## Installation

Clone the Repository:

```bash
https://github.com/RamyaMN28/Diverse_Recommender-System-on-MovieLens-dataset-.git
```

Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```
    
## Usage/Examples

Input: Provide a user_id to receive personalized movie recommendations.

Output: View top movie recommendations based on the NCF model and ε-Greedy Exploration techniques.
